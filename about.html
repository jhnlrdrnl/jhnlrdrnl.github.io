										<p>
											Exposing myself with leadership works in our organization, TUP GEAR as a Chief Technology Officer, I was able to 
											develop variety of skills as we partner our university organization with different people, organizations, and brands 
											in the success of every projects we deploy in the field of esports and gaming in the Philippines.

												<h3>Something else</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Considering my high position on our student organization and keeping my responsibilities as consistent as possible, it 
												is a wonder for me as to why I have a decent academic performance since I had known myself to be a lazy person. Maybe it
												is because of my passion that drives me to function. As a graduate of BS Computer Science, I have created many projects
												individually and with my colleagues whether if it for a fulfillment of a course subject or just because I wanted to create something.

												I hope I could improve my skills and create more while I experience, explore, and learn the professional industry. Thank you
												for your time and consideration on reading this. I hope you have a good day.
